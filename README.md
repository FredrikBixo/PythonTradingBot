XXX is a utility for analysing stock data using machine learning. The program uses different algorithms to “score” corporate stocks and present these scores in a easy to grasp manner.

The program is probably going to be split in to two parts a server and a client. The server part is the program which is always running, fetching data from the stock market, processes the data and saves it to database. The client is primarily just a utility for browsing the database in a easily comprehensible way.

Further down in this document there is a brainstorm draft for the client UI. Here we can see to the left stock listings ordered by user preference and each list item is clickable to display all stock data in full view to the right. In this right panel we can see all stock data relevant to Alphabet Inc. To the top we can see general info as symbol and name and just under it we have all the basic quantitative data. Just under it the client displays the daily score of the stock generated by the different scoring algorithms. At the bottom a graph is displayed for viewing long-term shifts. Other views might be implemented like a dashboard for quickly getting an overview of the users whole portfolio.
